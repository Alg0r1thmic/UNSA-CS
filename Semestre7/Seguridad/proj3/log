Device type: general purpose
Running (JUST GUESSING): Linux 3.X|4.X (87%)
OS CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:3 cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:4
OS fingerprint not ideal because: Host distance (21 network hops) is greater than five
Aggressive OS guesses: Linux 3.11 - 4.1 (87%), Linux 3.13 (85%)
No exact OS matches for host (test conditions non-ideal).
